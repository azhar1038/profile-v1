# My Portfolio website!

This is a static website created using [Astro](https://astro.build)  
Design is inspired from [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/)

I wanted this website to be as lite as possible, so plain React was out of question. I could have used Next.js but I wanted it to deploy on github itself which is not good for Next.js app. I even considered using plain HTML, CSS and JS too but then I stumbled upon Astro. It seemed like the perfect choice for my site and turns out I was right! When I tested with Lighthouse, I get around 100 score!
